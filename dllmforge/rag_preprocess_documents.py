# General document loader
# Based on: langchain_community.document_loaders (https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/)
# select the right loader based on the file type. Here we provide examples on the most common file types: pdf, docx, txt, csv, json, html, markdown, etc.
# the most important point is to know the format of input and output
